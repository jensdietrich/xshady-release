This `pom.xml` is a PoV project that demonstrates that `org.apache.servicemix.bundles:org.apache.servicemix.bundles.commons-collections:3.2.1_2` is vulnerable to `CVE-2015-7501`: `mvn test` under JDK 8 makes the test pass.

It was obtained by manually changing the artifact version to `3.2.1_2` in the `pom.xml` that `shadedetector` generated automatically for version `3.2.1_3`. `shadedetector` did not automatically determine that this artifact version was vulnerable because [the repo](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/servicemix/bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.commons-collections/3.2.1_2/) contains no source jar for it.

Thanks to @darakian for noticing that this version exists and is likely also vulnerable!
