# [CVE-2019-12402 -- Commons-Compress] (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12402)  from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)

Project uses `apache:commons_compress:1.18` , tests from https://github.com/apache/commons-compress/blob/4ad5d80a6272e007f64a6ac66829ca189a8093b9/src/test/java/org/apache/commons/compress/archivers/zip/NioZipEncodingTest.java
as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j).

Some minor changes made: 
1. Irrelevant tests removed
2. JUnit version replaced by Junit5
3. uses Java 8 (note that compress does not have to be build)
4. added timeout to `NioZipEncodingTest::partialSurrogatePair` to detect that computation is stuck in infinite loop

Note that one test __fails__ indicating the vulnerability! After replacing `apache:commons_compress:1.18` by `apache:commons_compress:1.19`
the respective test passes.
