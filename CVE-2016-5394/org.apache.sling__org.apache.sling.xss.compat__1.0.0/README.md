# [CVE-2016-5394 -- sling](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5394) from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)

Project uses `org.apache.sling:org.apache.sling.xss:1.0.8`, tests from https://github.com/apache/sling/commit/7d2365a248943071a44d8495655186e4f14ea294   
as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j).

Some minor changes made: 
1. JUnit version replaced by JUnit5, not using vintage (issues detecting tests) -- also note different argument order for `assertEquals()`!
2. several additional dependencies
3. resource `resources/SLING-INF/content/config.xml` added (needed in fixture), some additional code added whether file exists. The location is unusual but better than the original location in `src/main/resources/SLING-INF/content/config.xml`; now referenced as file (not resource)

Note that the tests __fail__ indicating the vulnerability!

Tests pass when replacing the sling dependency by `org.apache.sling:org.apache.sling.xss:1.0.12` which is mentioned
as the patched version in the [GHSA](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xwf4-88xr-hx2j).
