# Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 DoS via deserialisation vulnerability

Code checks bytecode of the vulnerable class if resource allocation `new AtomicLongArray(n)` is unchecked during custom deserialisation

Note: payload is set for size of array to be  1024, and hence will fail with just a deserialisation exception.
