# [CVE-2016-6798 -- sling](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6798) from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)

Project uses `org.apache.sling:org.apache.sling.xss:1.0.8`, test from https://github.com/apache/sling/commit/fb2719e8299fadddae62245482de112052a0e08c as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j).

Based on the CVE-2016-5394 POV in this repo (which made its own minor changes -- see its [README](../CVE-2016-5394/README.md)), with the resource and some test setup removed and `testGetValidXML()` shrunk to just the repro-ing test introduced in the above-mentioned commit.

Note that the test __fails__ indicating the vulnerability!

Passes when the dependency on `org.apache.sling:org.apache.sling.xss:1.0.8` in `pom.xml` is changed to the next version available in the Maven repo, namely `1.0.12`.
